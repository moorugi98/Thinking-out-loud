          "content": "I am currently my Master degree in cognitive science at Osnabrück university, Germany. In my Bachelor degree, I was most interested in convergence of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The idea is now often referred to as cognitive computational neuroscience with a identically titled conference. I have a huge respect for people working in the field of philsophy and I think there are much to be discussed about in researching cognition. And how we conceptualise what cognition actually means matter, as it will also decide what questions are to be answered and how we should approach it. This important realisation sadly often get swept away when one gets too focused with technical details. In my first semester of my Master degree, I had a chance to reflect that there are alternative ways to conceptualise cognition than what I’ve got used to. The idea is called enactivism and it tries to explain cognition in terms of agency and having a perspective. After I came in an initial contact with the idea, I’ve felt a bit lost since my brief investigation of the idea seemed like it opposed lots of approaches that I’ve learned previously. However, as pointed out by Tomasz Korbak 1, I now see how two world can come together under free energy principle. So now I am interested in understanding the compatibility between these approaches more deeply and plan to do my PhD in the direction. My other interest includes everything related to probability and data analysis, machine learning, computational neuroscience but also ethics and hidden motives of human behaviours. . https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-019-02243-4 &#8617; . |",
