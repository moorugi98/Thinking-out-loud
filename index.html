As the name of the blog suggests, this is a place where I think out loud and explore different ideas freely without a commitment to be correct. My interests include the emergence of cognition, consciousness, higher cognitive phenomena such as thoughts and decision making, evolution, hidden motives, neural networks as a model, complex systems, stats & data analysis, ethics, and, and,... the list goes on and on.
